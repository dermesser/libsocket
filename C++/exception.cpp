/**
 * @file exception.cpp
 * @brief Exception class in libsocket **CLASS FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY**
 *
 * The class defined here, socket_exception, is a
 * class for exception objects. Objects instantiated
 * from this class are thrown if something goes wrong.
 *
 * The class contains only the data member mesg and the
 * constructor which constructs the error string in mesg.
 * Typically, you'd create an object of this class with the
 * following call: `socket_exception(__FILE__,__LINE__,"Error Message");`
 *
 * The tokens are substituded by the preprocessor and show where
 * the error occurred.
