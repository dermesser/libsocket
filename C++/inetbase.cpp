/**
 *  @file inetbase.cpp
 *  @brief The base class for all internet-based sockets.
 *
 * 	inetbase.cpp defines the class inet_socket. This class
 * 	is used as base class in the hierarchy between socket and
 * 	the next specific class. Inheriting classes are inet_dgram,
 * 	inet_stream_client and inet_stream_server.
 *
 * 	The class contains the data elements host and port. If the inheriting
 * 	class is a client, like inet_stream_client or inet_dgram_client (via inet_dgram),
 * 	this fields contain the remote peer. If the inheriting class is a server socket,
 * 	this fields contain the address and the port to which the server is bound.
 *
 * 	The getters, gethost() and getport() may be used for a
 * 	server application to get the paramters of the remote peer.
