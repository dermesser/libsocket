/**
 * @file dgramclient.cpp
 * @brief Base class for all datagram-based socket classes
 *
 * 	dgramclient.cpp contains the class dgram_client_socket. This
 * 	class provides the read/write functions for connected datagram
 * 	sockets (alias client dgram sockets...). This helps to avoid
 * 	writing the same code more than one time.
 * 	The client datagram classes for specific domains which are
 * 	unix_dgram_client and inet_dgram_client inherit the functions
 * 	declared here to get the ability to send and receive
 * 	data via connected datagram sockets. It is not possible to use
 * 	a class which has this functions also for stream sockets because
 * 	the functions have to check if the socket is connected (bool connected).
 * 	In the stream classes, this check is realized by checking if the file
 * 	descriptor is -1 or not.
