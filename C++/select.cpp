/**
 * @file select.cpp
 * @brief Contains the class selectset which provides a neat interface for watching several sockets
 *
 * The class selectset implements a wrapper for the syscall select() which allows
 * to accept connections on more than one socket or communicate with multiple clients
 * without multithreading.
 *
 * New sockets may be added with add_fd(), accepting a child class of libsocket::socket.
 *
 * When all sockets are added, the select() call can be triggered by calling wait(). This
 * function returns a pair of vector<int>s, the first with the sockets ready for reading and
 * the second containing the sockets ready for writing.
