     * @brief selectset provides a simple interface to the system call select(3).
     *
     * To watch different sockets for new data to read or a possibility to write without using threads, use
     * this class. It is rather simple to use; add file descriptors (socket ids) using `add_fd()` specifying
     * whether to watch them for reading or writing and then call `wait()`; once there's data to be read or written
     * it returns a std::pair with vectors of `libsocket::socket*`, the first vector contains sockets ready for reading,
     * the second one contains those sockets ready for writing. Usually it's necessary to cast them to the actual socket type
     * using `dynamic_cast<>()`.
